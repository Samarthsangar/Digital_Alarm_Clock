# Digital_Alarm_Clock
A digital clock built with an alarm system is called as an alarm clock. Along with showing time it includes a preset timer to remember and trigger an event when the timer expires by generating an alarm. Alarms can be configured for different time intervals say daily or weekly which can trigger different set of actions. The actions can range from blowing a buzzer or switching on a  light. The sound of an alarm can be stopped by pressing the button or automatically stop by producing a beep sound in particular time duration. 
As mentioned above the digital clock need to be configured with time and appropriate alerts to be executed. In order to trigger alerts, it may need a different set of protocols there by this project can be extended to an IoT solution by using internet scale protocols like HTTP or MQTT. The idea of this project is to implement the digital clock by using a Micro Controller (PIC in our case) by using various interfaces like LCD and Keypad.
